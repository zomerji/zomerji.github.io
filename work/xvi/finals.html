    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Above lay the finals for the sixteenth shoot, my second project inspired by Lightmark. It is a further development in theme, expanding from the previous abstract and unartificial into explorations of the human subconscious and reality.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> is a relatively simple edit of a long exposure, only requiring minor corrections and tonal adjustments to achieve the final results. The colours are ideal; a variable blending-contrasting nature of passionate pinks, vibrant purples, and soft reds sweeping the subject's face of silklike ecstasy, cooperatively adorning it. The image perscribes itself a sobering aura of deep sensuality that easily subconsciously conveys to the viewer. It is an exemplar of the philosophy I have come to prefer through my numerous years of photographic work; simple, beautiful (at least to me), and powerful beyond conscious understanding.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is a sophisticated compounding of multiple exposures and supporting layers, which required two documents of filters and multiple masks and blends, and thus is certainly a methodolic juxtaposition against the previous final. Deliberate is the strong inclusion of deep magenta, chosen for its elements of power and surprise, a trick from the Fauvist playbook.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is a multicolour animation with a similar common set of themes as the other finals. Selective masking and blending resulted in the original image, which was progressively recoloured in 26 layers and tweened with four layers per layer to create a 96-frame above-HD animation. This was unfortunately hampered with GIF format's inherent 8-bit colour limit (256 total colours), leaving a suboptimal layered effect most apparent on the subject's face.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is similar to the first, though includes a blended star overlay akin to the second, as well as a selective brightening of the facial area in order to render it distinguishable as an element of focus.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is my second overall attempt at creating an animated video entirely from a photograph, this time in full-length and QHD (with a custom aspect ratio, closest to Ultra Panavision 70). The image was recoloured and corrected, and blended with a cosmic overlay into difference and hard light filters, to produce the effect of the subject not adorned by the cosmos, but a part of it. This was exported in three lighting configurations, from which two high-framerate keyframe animations were created from; the slower and brighter, and the faster and duller. The former was placed at consistent two-second intervals along the timeline to represent a heartbeat, whilst the latter was introduced more irregularly to present a flickering in somewhat parallel to the chosen music track.
