  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">The shooting itself required extensive experimentation, as it entailed the usage of a particular light painting method I was unfamiliar with; through closely moving a fiber optic lamp over a subject, various surreal effects could be created. Relevant were the camera settings (exposure time and aperture) and positioning, subject positioning and movement, and the colour of the lamp at the time of the exposure. It was difficult to have the aforementioned factors simultaneously ideal, and thus approximately one hundred attempts were required in order to achieve a workable quantity of results. This is one of the suboptimal examples, where the technique is evident.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Various attempts (ten overall) were made to attempt to optimally work with the results of the shooting, and this is one of them; two seperate photographs were combined with the exclusion filter and brightened. Unfortunately, it contributed little against other experimentations, and thus was not included in the finals.
