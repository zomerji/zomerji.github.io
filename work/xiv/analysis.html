    <p>This photograph is part of the <i style="font-size: 14px;">Sterne</i> album. It depicts a segment of the night sky, although it in itself is a compound image (as Ruff obtained 1000 photos from the ESO and compounded aspects that stood out to him), It’s purpose is to awe, and such it fulfils, with it’s size of 260 x 186cm (which is largely a presumption as I have not viewed this piece to that size). Larger photographs have a certain appeal, that being typically the larger presence of detail. This example presents such in it’s own way, through the very precise and inconsistent abundances of negative space. This essentially simplifies the image down to very few visual elements (consisting of a foreground - stars and nebulae, and a background - the void of space), but with a powerful subconscious feeling to it. Additionally, such a wide depth-of-field is present, but less in terms of actual focal length, and more of the fundamental portrayal of the image. The infinite vastness of space, in a finite and worldly-sized print, without any emotion to it, yet providing a deep-felt emotional impact to it.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Porträt: Blaue Augen (1991)</h3>
    <p>This photograph appears to be a portrait of a woman. Or is it? It’s a compound photo, which I found quite surprising, because the combined factor was so seamless it’s unnoticeable. Contextually, this portrait is one of a series wherein Ruff combined features of both males and females to create entirely new faces, and, in this case, turned their eyes blue. But I, as the viewer, am not supposed to know that. The Portraits are all surface-level images, where the viewer is presented with an individual that emotionally and subconsciously presents nil, and consequently we have nothing we can go by or explore other than the visual factor. The model’s expression is fairly neutral. The colours are more retro and sombre; less expressive. There is no form of pose or action. It directly opposes the conventional exemplar of a portrait photo, which is to convey the ‘human’ aspect; that including feelings, thoughts, ideas, desires, actions, and so on. Ruff, being his highly experimental and limitless self, discards any previous standards in favour of pushing the boundaries of photography.
