    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the fourteenth shoot, with inspiration derived from Thomas Ruff. With Ruff's work being highly experimental and varied, it was necessary for me to follow suit and attempt to create in new forms, resulting in what you have seen.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> of which is something of an experience, in regards to both the visual and auditory mediums, each of which have been extensively refined. The subject has been the administration of manipulation, most notably in the form of iridal transplanting (the imposition and subsequent altering and refining of another individual's irises onto hers), which required fine seperate non-destructive altering of the individual irises for both visual expression and plausibility, and ended up causing work on the eyes alone taking seven months to complete. Another notable factor is the audio, an altered exerpt of Valery Gergiev's rendition of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, (this exact rendition chosen for its powerful yet romantic finesse), featuring the addition of a high-frequency low-pass filter with a shallow roll-off and reverb in a left pan. This viscerally cooperates with a constant infrasonic sine note, a frequency that can only be felt and not heard, primarily through the alteration of neural activity. Inspiration is partly derived from the CIA's Gateway Process study, which overviewed the ability to transcend space and time through manipulation of the brain's resonance. Regardless, it would require a specialist sound setup with a low sub-bass frequency response to fully experience the audio.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> finals are results of experimentations with fractal generation of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets respectively. Both are number sets prevalent in nature defined from simple functions, expanding infinitely inward in endless swirls and spirals, intricate demonstrations of simplicity meaning more. Computationally through the application of custom formulae to the respective functions, as well as custom lighting and colour schemes as external stimuli, I was able to produce the results following numerous hours of multithreaded rendering.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> final was a peculiar effort, utilising artificial intelligence for facial generation. Following the independant manipulation of each generation's eyesets to a light blue colour, each was overlayed to its exact pupillary center points, and the animation was created with a single layer of tweening between each keyframe. Each indidivual has a differing facial geometry, and differing features adorning it, yet their eyes are all alike.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is a manipulation of AN/PVS-31A (a night vision device currently in operation with various special forces worldwide) imagery, kindly provided as it is illegal for me use or even view through it (due to ITAR regulations). The device is binocular (featuring two tubes), though the imagery was manipulated to resemble the effect of a more expensive and unobtainable panoramic counterpart (featuring four tubes), specifically the act of viewing a quiet exerpt of forest through it. Until recently, only the world's most elite military units would have been able to witness what you have.
