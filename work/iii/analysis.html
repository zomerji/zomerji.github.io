    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The Kick</h3>
    <p>It is easy to view the image as little more than comical in its essence, due to the opportune timing of the shot allowing the child on the advertisement board to seem as if they are kicking the male walking past. And whilst there does seem to be the element of lightheartedness, I believe it may something of depth to it. The child is a representation of the brand they are advertising, in this instant Clarks, the owner of the shop or outlet the male is passing. And so by kicking the pedestrian, evidently a consumer, it could mean that the photograph is in turn a representation of a hyperbolised capitalist attitude from a corporatist perspective. Regarding the visuality, the picture in its monochromacy retains Arnemann's signature high degrees of contrast and dynamic range, most evident in the pavement, though it does not compromise the windows of the shop. It is also worth noting how the light from the advertising board illuminates the pavement to a degree, and in that area of illumination the man is also highlighted in order to signify him as a subject of focus.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><i style="font-size: 15px;">Unnamed</i></h3>
    <p>This unnamed photograph most likely depicts a small extent of the Mediterranean Sea, though in a chromatic form that partially opposes Arnemann's typical monochromacy. It has evidently been shot at a low shutter speed, hence the surreal smoothness and translucency of the water that rather interestingly allows the seafloor to be viewed. The sky resembles the water in this regard, though is far more concealing of what lies beyond its surface. Light appears to deliberately be focused around the central island that acts majorly as a centre of focus, albeit along with the rocks in the foreground above the water. As with Arnemann's photographs, this example exhibits a strong aspect of dynamic range, though opposingly it also presents an elabourate degree of colour. Too much of the latter, I would say, for the sky around the island in particular is clearly oversaturated, and consequently shows a telltale edge around it. And on the island itself, the greens are almost unnatural.
