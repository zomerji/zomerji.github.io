    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">There are three main ‘sub-shoots’ in this one, each being inspired by the following albums from Ruff;  <i style="font-size: 14px;">Portraits</i>, <i style="font-size: 14px;">JPEGS</i>, <i style="font-size: 14px;">Blaue Augen</i>, and <i style="font-size: 14px;">Nacht</i>.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> is a very manipulated photograph, some alterations being the eyes, page writing, and skin. It is the first photograph that features my updated method of iris enhancement, thereby having a greater extent of microscopical dynamic range, more controlled levels of brightness, and therefore a better aesthetic appeal and visceral impact. This same technique is applied to the four alterations in the <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a>, where I found the variation in various individuals’ irises produced varying minor subconscious effects (despite being enhanced to the exact same visual extent) when sampled and implemented onto a model’s sclera (replacing the default iris). The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is probably the most powerful photograph in this shoot, although I didn’t expect it to have the visual impact that it has, initially. After editing the skin and eyes and performing various other edits, it proved to be something that at least for me had a strong and deep emotional presence. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is a fusion of inspiration from Portraits, Blaue Augen, and Nacht, which would be the hardest to theoretically combine, which is the challenge I took on. The addition of noise, grain, and layer filtering makes a night vision effect I’d deem as plausible, but the more difficult part was definitely how I altered and implemented the eyes into the picture without them seeming imposing or unrealistic. The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is a more ‘natural’ and unedited example, because the rest of the photos were manipulated, so I thought I’d have something as an exception to it. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> is my own interpretation of Nacht, but the night vision effect is artificially created through the addition of noise, grain, layer filtering, as well as other adjustments. It is the same effect that’s used in the fourth, albeit more pronounced and refined. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> is a methodical improvement over the fifth following a revision of my techniques in studio photography and editing, and features a seamless GIF insert that oscillates the iridal saturation between natural (default) to ‘full’ (the standard extent used for the <i style="font-size: 14px;">Blaue Augen</i> enhancements). Admittedly, I made an error in the lighting setup, resulting in a bleached effect in part of the photo. This was eliminated with selective tonal gradienting and healing. The <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a> is similar to the sixth. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a> is heavily edited picture, and is easily the most experimental of the shoot. I wanted to break free of the compositional boundaries set by Canon’s APS-C, whilst fusing a challenging mixture of <i style="font-size: 14px;">JPEGS</i> and <i style="font-size: 14px;">Blaue Augen</i>. The result was a horizontal expansion into an anamorphic aspect ratio (2.35:1, the most common, from 3:2) by digital reconstruction of part of the models face, four selectively-implemented extents of pixelation, and a careful blending of the enhanced eyes in between the clarity and conformity factors. The <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> has not been manipulated at all, but I have enhanced it’s dynamic range and colours. It uses two extents of pixelation. It’s overall a lot simpler than the ninth, although it has a different purpose. The aspect ratio, instead of the common 2.35:1, is 2.40:1, and the image is intended resemble a cinematic Panavision 35 scene; almost a nostalgia towards the anamorphic era of cinema.
