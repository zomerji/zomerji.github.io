    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">My passion with the camera started through the production of videos on my old smartphone in 2014, which switched entirely to photos with a DSLR once I entered the subject of photography in school. With this episode of education coming to a close, seven years later, I believed a return to videography with the skills I have learned over these years was only fitting.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The initial plan for a videography shoot had been set for late Winter, with the intention of capturing the Christmas lights on seperate Panasonic Lumix DC-S5 and borrowed Sony a7S III rigs. Unfortunately, it had to be cancelled only twelve hours ahead, due to a family member obtaining COVID and Central London entering Tier 4 lockdown almost simultaneously. After replanning and stringent patience, a new and different opportunity was made available.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Filming was carried out in five locations within Central London, with the Lumix DC-S5 (reborrowing the a7S III was painfully not a possibility) shooting in 4K RAW H.265, 10-bit colour, a 4:2:2 aspect ratio, and full frame with a 20-60mm lens. A gimbal was utilised, providing an extent of stability and smoothness to dynamic takes. However, a mistake was made in that the Face Detect function was left on, which resulted in occasional focus losses while recording amongst people.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Editing was conducted within DaVinci Resolve 17, which provided an immeasurable edge over Photoshop (which has been used for previous video edits) with its highly powerful and intricate integrated toolset, including the most advanced colour grading available. Black and white was a chosen factor from the beginning of this phase, in order to exploit the natural and artifial formal elements (including light, texture, and form) and minimise visual distraction from scattered colours, and was implemented through an LUT. Clips were selected and trimmed to appropriate lengths in order to maximise expression without evoking boredom, with most of their cuts made to the keyframe in rhythm with the backing track. Though one transition features compounding of two clips using individual keyframing and the former video's wall as a natural divider. Despite the monochromatic nature of the edit, colour grading was utilised, to impose a gentle blue tinge to shadows in order to express the factor of night and its subsequent connotation of coolness. In addition, highlights and shadows were adjusted to allow tonal variation. The edit was exported and is provided above in 4K.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">There is only a single final of the final project. Though combining the effort and time dedicated to it, not to mention the sophistication and difficulty behind both shooting and editing it, I would easily consider it equivalent to ten or more photographs.
