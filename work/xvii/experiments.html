  <h3>Videography
  <img style="padding-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src=misc/rig.webp>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">The shooting aspect of this project alone entailed more experimentation than multiple photographic counterparts combined, and it was more than simply videoing instead of photographing. Videography, especially on a full-frame mirrorless video-orientated machine, required careful individual setting of elements such as; shutter angle, aperture, picture profile, frame rate, ISO, bitrate, and colour depth. Any of these could have been the difference between an effective and compromised sequence, and more often than not adjustment of numerous was necessary upon changing settings, as is frequent with the much-varying light conditions present in the capital later in the day. Part of the camera 'rig' was a gimbal, which was far from a 'forget while using' tool, instead itself requiring remote setup via Bluetooth, controlling via integrated joystick, and very careful and deliberate movement. A wide range of shots were attempted, including pans, statics, dynamics, and longer takes.

  <h3>Editing
  <img style="padding-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src=misc/editing.webp>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Editing was another adventure, where I was able to utilise professional editing software for the first time (DaVinci Resolve 17; the much simpler and less specialised Photoshop was used for prevous video edits), resulting in another learning experience in order to effectively harness the wider tools available. Lengthy experimentations were made in the adjustment of formal elements and compositions (similar to photography), and additionally in keyframing, colour grading (Resolve has the most thorough grading on the market), transitioning, and enhancements such as interpolation and stabilisation.
