    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Roma</h3>
    <p><i style="font-size: 14px;">Roma</i>, winner of 134 accolades including the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, is the only Cuarón film I have witnessed in entirety. It depicts the ordeals of an indigenous housekeeper working for a middle class family in Mexico during period of instability and unrest. The cinematography is easily the most iconic aspect of this film beyond its monochromatic form, fully encapsulating the element of storytelling required to deliver the picture; it is not intimately close but distanced, and not chasing but observing in a flawlessly preemptive fashion, as if the recounting of a memory in clarity. Unremarkable, but that is the essence of it; the viewer is a part of the 1970s story, not simply a viewer of it. Despite being shot in colour and only edited in black and white, the tones are perfectly emulative and unreflective of such, and instead of deduct, contribute majorly towards the classical aesthetic. Despite the perpetual factor of harsh reality firmly rooted in <i style="font-size: 14px;">Roma</i>, it often becomes lost in surrealism, swiftly tugging you from the seat of relatability you had become accustomed to and soon dropping you back into it; noteworthy examples being when the protagonist's shopping trip for her upcoming baby's cot is suddenly caught in the midst of the Corpus Christi Massacre, or when a beach visit becomes a struggle for survival against drowning.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Gravity</h3>
    <p><i style="font-size: 14px;">Gravity</i> has obtained a total of 98 accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects, and portrays the survival efforts of two astronauts stranded in space after their mission takes a catastrophic turn. The opening scene alone is a justification, a dozen-minute long take detailing the mission's swift descent into disaster, the camerawork close and steady as if the viewer is a part of the crew whilst chaos ensues, then detaching and latching onto the protagonist as she becomes separated from the destroyed Shuttle and the remaining astronauts. Though easily the most alluring aspect of <i style="font-size: 14px;">Gravity</i> to this day is the visual effects, which present everything from 20,000mph orbit collisions to the Earth looming in the background, down to the details; I could only imagine how immersive the IMAX experience must have been eight years ago. Unfortunately, <i style="font-size: 14px;">Gravity</i>'s vice happens to be the writing, with repetitive and implausible events compromising the film as a whole to an extent, notably the events of intense debris strikes and the protagonist's ability to travel between space stations using only a fire extinguisher, respectively.
