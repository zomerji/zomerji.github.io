    <p>This image is somewhat evidently depicting tree bark in a macro mannerism, though is surprisingly not a part of Miller's <i style="font-size: 14px;">Bark Art</i> album. It is clear that, as with the other photographs Miller has taken of the same type of subject matter, the focus is primarily on the natural texture, pattern, and tone within each's matroscopic or perhaps microscopic exhibit. Though in this case, the bark's matter is remarkably resemblant of a Post-Impressionist art piece, most akin I would say to <i style="font-size: 14px;">Starry Night</i> by Vincent van Gogh in its wispy form. It is due to such that this is the example of Miller's tree images that I most prefer. However, noticeable is the bluriness within the lower part of the picture, which is an inconsistency due to its asymmetry with the rest of the photo. I would otherwise state that black and white would be the preferable route for emphasis of the prestated three factors, but in this case the warm wooden hues reinforce the natural aspect of what may as well be a natural painting.

    <p>This photograph depicts a row of trees overlooking a body of water, presumably a lake. Present is the intertwining of the aspects of order and disorder, the former being the relative consistency among the tree placement and symmetry of said subjects in their reflection across the water, and the latter being the arbitrarity of the form of effectively every item the photo consists of. Composition is the strongest factor of the image, with the tree assortment, reflection, and sky placed in order to adequately express each of these to cooperatively form the product the viewer pays witness to. Though light is arguably what grants the photograph its appeal, the golden zone bringing about a silhouetting phenomena to the trees as well as a range of warm and cold colours split across the entirety of the photo with the darkened horizonal line.
