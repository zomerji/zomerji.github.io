    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">33/365 (Bargaining)</h3>
    <p>This photograph depicts numerous outstretched arms, each with a note of money in hand, reaching towards a skeletal hand with a sand timer dangling from its wrist. One could interpret the sand timer as time itself, and the skeleton as death, and so the 'alive' hands are attempting to bargain with death for more time. The cage could symbolise the common entrapment within life and reality all the living share, with the presence of time ominously hovering overhead, and the hand of death awaiting to claim its next victim. The image contrasts order and chaos, with all elements arranged ideally, and yet combining to portray a sense of static spontaneousity. Its cold hue provides a sense of cold intensity, of warmth and empathy being absent.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><i style="font-size: 15px;">Unnamed</i></h3>
    <p>This photograph depicts a subject undoing a zipper around their neck. It is certainly a visually metaphorical reference to suicide, in particular the art of throat cutting, through the 'unzipping' of the throat. Strings emerge downwards from it, clearly representational of blood, albeit black and therefore presumably symbolic of the voidlike state a depressed individual would feel within. The fact of the primary visual metaphor being a zipper also suggests the act to be considered routine or mundane (as undoing a zipper would be), likely a result of said thought's recurrance. Although the colour in this photograph is all but drained, there remains the slightest tone of humanity, the slightest tone of life left in the subject.
