    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Above are the finals for the fourth shoot, with inspiration derived from the work of Christian Hopkins. This proved to be a tedious project, with the experimentation and development of various new ambitious techniques and skills, resulting in the temporary reduction of finals from ten to six in order to preserve quality in the face of quantity.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> entailed a removal of the entirety of the subject's eyes (with the retention of some reflection for visual plausibility) and the background wall (with the careful preservation of the skirtings), and the tonal enhancement solely of the subject, within a vignetted frame.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> was another erasure of the eyes (though this time including black tears painted from them), and with the addition of a white screen on the phone both directly and onto its reflection. The photograph was transformed to be compositionally ideal (with straight, aligned lines), and the surrounding windows were cut from their frames and inverted to provide the harsh background. The subject was brightened both fully and with the dodge tool, to resemble the metaphoric paleness of the background she stands in front of.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is a heavy manipulation, wherein parts of the original window were sampled and resized to construct the larger and compositionally perfected version present, with the factors of lighting, shadow, reflection, and form all individually applied to each item. The subject features a constructed reflection (where a facial shot was combined with the flipped body), and areas of herself selectively brightened and adjusted to optimally reflect the surrounding partially-curated lighting conditions.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This was adapted to a night environment with the <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> final, entailing an adjusting and altering of all elemental parts and factors (for example the reflections and shadows, and the darkening of most of the subject's self), as well as the addition of the Moon in a compositionally-ideal position amongst the trees.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Spacial reconstruction was further developed during editing of the <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a>, with an entire room created from shape and transformation tools in Photoshop, and without the utilisation any 3D program. The ceiling alone features over two hundred elements in order to span the entire over-9K-resolution Panavision 70 aspect ratio. The subject was intricately cut out and adjusted to plausibly reflect the fabricated room's lighting condition.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> is a return to relative simplicity, with only the subject cut out, moved, and adjusted, and the table partially reconstructed with a leg extended downwards into the darkness of the gradient background. Simpler, at least compared to other finals.
