  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This is my Year 13 photography portfolio, and serves to display all of my A-Level Photography work for this academic year. If you have reached this far, then you already virtually know how to utilise this website (and in case you don't know, you can return to the work directory by clicking on the title to the left).
  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">And that may raise a few questions in your mind, those likely being; "Why make a website? Why don't you just stick everything on an anthology of Google Slides or in a big black book like what everyone else is doing? Why bother with all this headache?" Firstly, because I see a website-based portfolio as the most feasible option for me. There are no restrictions to it like there are with books and slides; I'm not limited to the fixed tools, space, and structure of a presentation, nor the imperfect and media-starved nature of a book. A portfolio is an experience. That may sound hyperbolic, but it isn't; you visually explore them, feel them with your fingertips in the form of the turning of pages or the clicking of a mouse, and emotionally resonate as you go through everything the student has provided for you in their own individual mannerism. I want to provide you with the most optimal experience possible, and I am frustrated with the barriers that other options stubbornly retain.
  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">In Years 9 and 10, I was using the big black book. All too familiar even to this day is the sticky-fingered nightmare of typing, printing, gluing, positioning, tearing, reprinting, repositioning, regluing, and so on for seemingly eternity. Sure, books are tactile, and that's a significant advantage over presentations, but they are limited to static media forms and are far too uninteractive, not to mention that they are compositionally restrictive (being in a fixed A2 or A3 form) and fundamentally flawed (anything handmade will always have human flaws; we are not robots or computers). For Years 11 and 12, I had the option of using Google Slides instead, and that was an option I took with open arms. Gone were the imperfections and a lot of limitations, and in came forgiving configuratability, computational precision, convenience, and room to experiment. I thought that was as perfect as things could be, but as time went on, I found the presentation-orientated structure to be far too limiting to be effective. A slide is unimmersive with it's interface, untactile with it's arrow-based navigation format and lack of explorative features, and hinders experimentability and customiseability with it's strict PowerPoint-esque basis. Sure, it's far better than books and good enough for our [students'] cause, but since when was "good enough", well, good enough?
  <p style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Experimentation is key in the multiverse of arts, and I have always been exploring better ways to have my work more effective. This year has been no exception. At the start of Year 13, I spent a considerable amount of time refining a Slides composition that this year's work was to be situated on. It was a layout based on the visual mathematics, specifically the Golden Ratio, to an incredible extent, intended to maximise aesthetic appeal and serve as a flexible canvas to present my work.

  <p class=textcaption>A slide of the initial Year 13 portfolio experiment; visual mathematics at work. The aspect ratio is &#981; multiplied by the original 4:3 scaled height to produce a scaled and absolute golden rectangle. Border margins are &#981; of a centimetre. Elemental layout is perfectly scaled to the inside of the border margins to the golden ratio, and the elements themselves are scaled to seperate golden rectangles. The space between elements is precisely &#981; divided by 10. Font size is &#981; cubed. The line guides were there only for constructive purposes and would have been removed for the finished product.
  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The experiment, as far as was tried, worked. My work could be flexibly displayed in an appealing but informative design format that, most importantly, exercised aesthetic subtlety (because arguably the most aesthetic tricks are the subliminals ones you don't visually realise but your subconscious processes). Though it was after I had engineered it to an effective degree through feedback and lengthy tinkery that COVID became significantly prominent and quarantine was consequently introduced.
  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The extensive amount of time spent at home allowed me to evaluate if the design direction was the most effective for my purpose. In the end, despite the mathematically-derived format's feasibility and potential, I came to the conclusion that Google Slides simply wasn't enough of a basis, for reasons I've stated earlier. Certain limitations simply cannot be bypassed or ignored. And so it was during the period of lockdown that I took up a challenge; learning HTML and all things web design.
  <p style="padding-bottom: 5px;">I began working on a web-based portfolio loosely based around but by no means limited to the earlier Golden Ratio design, and refining it with the feedback from my photography teacher and fellow classmates (all of the latter have worked on Slides) into something as beautiful but concise as I could have it be. It has been one hell of an experiment that has consumed an immeasurable degree of my time, patience, and effort. But if you are reading this, then it has worked.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Everything in this website has been designed by me and me only using solid coding software (my choice was <a href=https://github.com/atom/atom target=_blank>Atom</a>). No creation software like Wix and Dreamweaver has been used. Whilst I have consulted web developers, at no point did I ask anyone to do any of the work for me. Nothing from online resources (such as W3Schools and CSS Tricks) has been copied over (although I have learned from them), and nothing from existing websites has been plageurised or reverse-engineered.
  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">For me at least, it has been a considerable challenge to learn and apply web design in such a constrained space of time. Yes, it has been far more tedious than any presentation or book. Yes, I have gone through far more trouble than I would've had to otherwise. Yes, it has very often bestowed within me the upmost desire to drive my head through a brick wall. But if exploring it has provided you, the examiner, a more unique and sensically thorough experience than you would've obtained with any other portfolio, then it has all been worth it.
