    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the eighth shoot, which has once again been a considerable deviation from the original photographer's work. Unlike in previous shoots, a common focus here was to express natural imperfection, rather than attempt to manipulate it to an otherwise artificial fashion.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> depicts a tree stump shallowly residing amongst grass. Through the introduction of monochromacy and textural softening, with the intention to visually and metaphorically equalise both elements (as a tree inherently belongs to the ground), an artistic effect was created. The stump resembles watercolour on the grassy canvas, cooperatively amounting to a natural painting. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a>, and <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a> are results of experimentations and developments with macro photography, a genre I have conducted little of. The focus wason exploiting bark, specifically the formal element factors of line, form, tone, and texture. Selective editing such as manual dodging/burning and blurring was undertaken, particularly in the fifth and ninth finals, to assist in the expression of said formal elements as well as depth. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is a different attempt on textural expression, this time encased in an abstract demeanour. Three primary elements (the water and underwater surfaces, and the tree reflection) collide and intermix, all simultaneously complimenting and obstructing each other, resulting in a fragmented viewpoint of nature that challenges the orderly light it is commonly presented in. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a> are divergences from the macro theme, that still retain a hint of Miller's characteristic natural aspect. These explore themes of power and order, by presenting humankind's creation from nature in contrast with nature itself, the former standing above the latter yet against each other. All of a sudden, the perfection of artificiality does not seem perfect. The <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> is similar to the previous macro works on bark, with its enhanced formal elements and depth, though a differing development more akin to the fourth and eighth finals. Colour has been permitted to a very limited degree to compliment the darker tones in the conveyance of a sense of sickness, emanating from the mushroom as the central subject of the photograph. The only lightness in this image is the tree's mutation, growing parasitically from it.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">In hindsight, whilst there is an extent of variety regarding subject matter, it would have been ideal to present a greater range of such, as well as finals material; most finals above are monochromatic and static.
