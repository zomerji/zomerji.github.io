    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">New York, 2001 - Searching for survivors.</h3>
    <p>This photograph was captured in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, hence the dystopian aura provided largely by the haziness of the suspended dust, and the abundance of debris littering the ground. The colour yellow, a typically optimistic and warm colour, seems sickly and perhaps even radioactive in its overwhelming presence all over the image. The three subjects appear to be dressed somewhat ordinarily, contrasted both visually and metaphorically against the inordinarity of the setting (and most definitely the contextual event itself). Light would be the most important primary factor here; the hazing of it from the dust to create a gentle glow from the sky onto the street and near-silhouetting of the three individuals is easily the distinctive attribute. However, I feel that boosting the contrast would not only further tonal variation but also fully silhouette the primary subjects, and thus further the dystopian theme.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Afghanistan, 1986 - Mujahedin praying while on an operation against the Soviet army.</h3>
    <p>This photograph depicts a moment in the midst of the Soviet-Afghan War, wherein the fighters have temporarily laid down arms to pray. It may present something of an irony, due to the act being an entirely peaceful act, and yet there are weapons of war being prayed upon. Or perhaps it is symbolic of the Mujahideen themselves; the fact that, even to this day (albeit in different form, known as the Taliban), they do not allow their guard down for a moment despite what peace there may be. The high angle composition works well to allow focus on the individuals' actions, not the individuals themselves, which in turn provides a more metaphoric and symbolic (than portraitive) sense to the image.
