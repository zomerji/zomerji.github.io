    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the ninth shoot, with inspiration taken from Lightmark. This is likely one of the more ambitious shoots, due to the utilisation of techniques I was previously less familiar with. Due to the absence of a tripod for most of the shooting, a light stand was adapted to be able to mount my cameras.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Both the <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a> were photographed on a quiet street, with their only editing being the black and white filter to optimise aesthetic appeal and viewing. The phantom-esque effect was created either through standing still (with the former) or retreating linearly (with the latter). The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> are similar motorway long exposures in the intention to improve consistency of viewership, though varying in approaches; the former features a red recolour (to that of the tail lights), whilst the latter is entirely devoid of colour. The fourth additionally incorporates selective masking, combining the light painting effect of multiple exposures. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is a unique and unedited counterpart to the motorway exposures, adding points of focus in the form of two subjects creating orbs of light. The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> are attempts at introducing a factor of surrealism by the incorporation of human subjects, improving depth of subject matter in cooperation with both the foreground and background's multiple light painting surfaces. The latter includes a selectively-added palette recolour, contributing to its futurist theme already provided by the foregrounded effect of a passing emergency vehicle's lighting. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> is a simple, unedited exposure, photographed at an ideal location and angle to capture not only vehicular and street lighting, but the reflection of both on the tarmac below to detail. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a> are applications of the street shooting to that of a more sobering environment. With the former, in a field only gently illuminated by moonlight, a trail of light hops and skips into the darkness. In the latter, it frantically scurries across a dark garden into the refuge of the home's light.
