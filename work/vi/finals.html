    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the second shoot. Akin to the first, at no point did I have any intention of replicating or even minicing Calio's work. All ten photographs are derived from my interpretation of his photographs.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> are of a rain-swept streets, where adjustment of light and tone was necessary to best exploit the activity, decorations, and reflections. Present is an arbitrary blur, caused by an amassment of raindrops on the lens during the period of rain in the shoot, which I decided to leave on for the most part to experiment with as a natural form of bokeh.
    The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> carries much of the same essence, though features selective dodging and burning, as well as tonal adjustment. The result could be regarded as symbolic, with the blinding display upon the shop looming over the individuals as if capitalism itself above the ordinary family.
    Careful but ambitious experimenting with tones and colours lead to the <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a>, where the decorative lights and their reflection on the moist cobble were selectively emphasised, and the two individuals darkened into silhouettes.
    The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a>, and <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> have a focus on the formal elements of line, form, tone, and texture, under the envelope of monochromacy. The latter of them is unique in lack of editing, though has had its signs brightened in order to have them subjects of focus.
    The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a> continue the experimentations with light and reflections. The former of which had its tonal variation increased, with certain areas darkened (including the individuals, whom were silhouetted). The latter had a moderation in brightness in order to improve tonal variation whilst preserving the shop lights' luminocity factor.
    The <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a> had a similar formal element focus as previous finals, though additionally features various major compositional improvements; the window has been resized and reshaped, and the area outside of it blackened.
