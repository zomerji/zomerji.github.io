    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Running Fence, Biei, Hokkaido, Japan. 2007</h3>
    <p>Landscape photography often retains a cluttered demeanour, due to the typical nature of attempting to capture as much of a setting as possible (either compositionally, or visually), and so it is easy to forget how much it is possible for a photographer to remove from a landscape yet still have an appealing image. In this case, all we really have are a dark fence and a distinguishable horizon line; the snow itself acts as negative space, as does the sky that it is reflected upward towards. In such regard, there are three main elements, and of varying tonal variation to distinguish each. Though the almost total lacking of visible positive space does not have the photograph itself seem lacking at all; rather, at least to myself, it carries a certain appeal. Less visual elements are easier to comprehend and perhaps understand.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Watchtower, Study 10, Wolcheon, Gangwondo, South Korea, 2006</h3>
    <p>This image has been taken in the Hwacheon-gun county of South Korea, presumably near the border with the country's northern counterpart. And whilst the photograph is most likely simply depicting the necessary measure for national security (that being the border), it seems to represent or symbolise something else entirely. Both the fence and the watch tower appear to loom imposingly over the viewer as if trapping them, the former of which perhaps representing an authoritarian figure constantly and tirelessly watching over. The lacking of brighter tones in the monochromacy furthers the dystopian theme, as it introduces a duller mood to the image; nothing is bright. Regardless, therein lies an irony; the photograph was not taken in North Korea, the ideal embodiment (or as close to it as there presently is) of authoritarian dystopia, instead of the multitudes-freer Southern neighbour.
