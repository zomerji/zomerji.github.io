    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Above are the finals for the twelth shoot, with inspiration taken from the work of James Nachtwey. This shoot was a deviation from Nachtwey's heavy focus on depicting human subjects in dynamic fashion, instead portraying above the effects of humanity in static form.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> was a relatively conventional portrait, albeit with its focus on composition; the sunlit left edge of the tower continues down the leaved and flowered memorial wall, whilst bare tree branches streak across its right as if supporting it. Despite the sunlight being most prominent on the left side of the image, it covers effectively the entirety of the sky in near-uniformity. The light tones and elements of nature are intended to assist in subtly conveying the theme of life beyond tragedy.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> are similar in intent, both to simplistically portray the contents of the memorial wall as if on paper, to maximise the emotional and mental expression it contains. The former is less so and has a foreground focus, whilst the latter presented more plainly; both were different approaches for the same purpose.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is resemblant of the first, but instead combines it with the wall writing aspect of the second and fourth to create a more emotionally surface-level effect, where the emotional expression (the writing) and the metaphorical embodiment of the expression (the tower) is both combined and contrasted.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is by far the most edited, utilising selective masking and adjusting of various elements to transform a daylight portrait into a surrealist nighttime version. The Milky Way above gently casts its stellar light onto Grenfell, illuminating it in the dark. A vein vaguely flows through centre of the galaxy exerpt, meeting the tower's top between the two iconic messages embroided onto its cover. Leading into it is the staircase that was previously parallel to the lift, but now ascends to space. Those lost are not gone, for they have only departed, and now reside amongst the stars.
