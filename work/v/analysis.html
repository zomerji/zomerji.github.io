    <p>Lightmark's <i style="font-size: 14px;">No. 78</i> depicts the Giant Tingle Tree in Walpole-Nornalup National Park, Australia. The tree itself is the world's oldest living eucalypt, and has had its hollows burned from fire. Within the latter, the orb (the light painted subject, some form of which is featured in Lightmark's works) dwells, which could symbolise the aged heart of the plant and the continued life in the visual form of light that ascends the burned internals. Indeed, its circular shape seems appropriate, as do the vertical streaks which might as well resemble the texturing of the plant the subject is encapsulated in. The balance of light both 'internally' and externally is about ideal; there is enough illumination on the tree's outside in order to have it distinguishable in the surrounding darkness, though not too much as to draw the viewer's attention away from the inside. The light subject itself is also I assume a high aperture has been utilised, to be able to best express the texture of as much of the tree as possible, as well as the light subject.

    <p>This photograph depicts an area of forest in the Buchenw√§lder im Rosengarten nature preserve near Hamburg, Germany. It is a peculiar example in that there is no singular subject or group of subjects as there are in many other of Lightmark's works, and not in the 'standalone' sense (where the light subject or group of such is on its own amongst the natural backdrop). Rather, light is utilised to press the tree trunks forth as the subjects of focus, and have the otherwise still area seem all the more dynamic with presentations of fire straddling each subject. The involvement of red is useful in this regard, as it is a psychologically stimulating colour associated with excitement, and symbolises danger. Typically, a long exposure in a natural environment will do little to exit the state of stillness it most likely inherently expresses, but by practically manipulating the setting, Lightmark have been able to do just so.
