    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the fifth shoot. Observations may conclude that some of the photographs are not entirely or much in the style of Andreas Gursky, and whilst such is subjectively correct, please note that I have not intended to replicate or even mimic his work. I started this shoot off with the broad objective of exercising what skills and methods I had developed over the past few years with photography, and more so, editing, as well as developing new ones. Gursky is not a compromising photographer nor editor, so I took the immense challenge in similar fashion. In the end, despite over 2000 images taken in a variety of environments, almost all were inadequate for the purpose.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> resembles a Romanticist scene, demonstrative of the true scale and grandeur of the natural world against humankind. A duplicate layer of enhanced colour and contrast was blended in a vertical gradient, providing the transition from dull beach to restless ocean. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is derived from experimentations on perspective manipulation, wherein the image was subject to content aware horizontal expanding, and a portion of the background sea was transformed into a shallower angle and blended into the foreground, to create a seamless panoramic. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a>, and <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> feature mostly recolour and transformative edits (rather than reconstructive), as there was no necessity to extensively manipulate them to achieve intended results, and to provide a variety in editing methodologies and techniques. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is a horizontally-expanded and repeated panoramic, with random edits across it made in order to present the element of arbitrarity (otherwise compromised through the repetition necessary to plausibly expand the image), and a vertical gradient sky replacement. The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is a conventional edit (with alterations in tone, contrast, et cetera), aside from the sky replacement (with multiple cloud exposures selectively blended), and the upward scaling of the background town through a combination of masking, blending, and healing. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> required corrective edits due to a minor camera error, which were successful. Otherwise, contrast and darken filter blending is featured, alongside the addition and plausibleblending of various objects including rocks, waves, a cliff side, and a few surfaced individuals. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> has incorporated selective recolouring, and replacement of the subject and sky, in order to ideally convey Romanticist themes akin to the first and other finals. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a> required six seperate careful blending additions, under monochromatic colour grading, to achieve a Gursky-esque hyperreal illusion of a structure far more daunting and intricate than it was in reality.
