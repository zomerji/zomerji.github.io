    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">That was the tenth shoot, conducted upon the basis of inspiration from Michael Kenna's photography. Of note is the reduction of finals, which has been implemented for the sake of quality emphasis; I have considered it to be more optimal to have fewer but more effective photographs.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I realised Kenna's most striking work is objectively with the least subject matter, which counteracted my previous belief from the tedious Gursky project that a higher quantity and prominence of subject matter generally created a more remarkable and expressive photograph. And thus, I sought for this project to eliminate absolutely all that was of secondary visual presence, leaving only the very fundamental.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Two major applications of this philosophy are the <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a>, results derived from foreground underexposing against a Golden Zone sky during the photographing stage, and subsequent relatively minor enhancements including removal of excess elements and contrast boosting. Each of these finals is almost surreal, a moment seemingly-orchestrated.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is a vertical inversion of a small lake's image and reflection, with a segment of the former eliminated and replaced to create a peculiar surrealist illusion. Whilst on the more complex side compared to other finals, it is a different type of experiment on simplicity and viewpoints.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is derived from the aligning of the sun through a raised hut-like structure during the photographing, and incorporates increased negative space to optimally exploit the contrast of pure silhouetting against intense sunlight into the minimalist form of this shoot. The expanded negative space itself contains minor contrast, representative of the fading state of the sky during the Golden Hour.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is perhaps the minimalist philosophy at its visual and visceral maximum. The hill was transformatively unwinded into a flat plane, and the subjects resized, to cooperatively form a scene almost beyond reality in its cinematic fashion. Attention has been provided to the miniscule, including the tone of sky, and the angle and shape of the landscape (including the smoothness of each earthly bump and gradient change). Only three elements exist, one if considering their interconnected nature, and yet the room for emotional interpretation is incredibly broad.
