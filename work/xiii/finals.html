    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Above are the finals for the thirteenth shoot, inspired by the works of Lucio Fontana. It has been the first 'physical' shoot, in the sense that it has only involved work that was physically altered (and not on editing software).
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">All finals (except the fifth) were created through the physical manipulation of painted canvases, wherein a box cutter was used to lacerate, and coloured card was placed behind, completing Fontana's Spatialist illusion. All paintings were art finals that had been left unwanted by their original creators, and so by reusing and repurposing, there is the subconscious element of reviving them into a different life. Contrarily, there is the element of death; through the repurposing method, I am destroying the crescendo of each individual's art project, tearing into its skin and killing it. Throughout the process of undertaking this shoot, this subconscious conflict played measures within me; I was never entirely sure if I was the destroyer or the resurrector. Perhaps I was both. At least I know which the art department classed me as.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">There was always the Dadaist factor (refer for example to Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, or Man Ray's Cadeau), the art of rejecting all logic, reason, and aestheticism through the repurposing of others' work.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> is an animation created from multiple photographs, each of which had a different colour background. The layers have been overlayed to the pixel and separated with thirty frames of tweening each, providing a smooth and static transition between colours that resembles a beating heart or breathing lung beneath slashed skin.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is of a vandalised monitor, showing the result of damage primarily to the internal layers of an LCD screen. Despite varying from the other finals, it is inherently similar in underlying meaning; the 'perfect' undisturbed state has been violently broken into, destroyed, repurposed into something beyond the ordinary and beyond meaning.
