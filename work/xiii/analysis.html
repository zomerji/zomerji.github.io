    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Concetto Spaziale, Attesa (1967)</h3>
    <p>Themes of interdimensionality and artwork transcending beyond reality and conscious have previously been explored (see 'b'), though this will overview a different artistic take through an entirely different genre. Enter one of the many "Spatial Concept, Waiting" works by Lucio Fontana, each of which instantly distinctive through its single or numerous slashes across a solidly-coated and featureless canvas. 1967 is adorned with a dramatic and bloody red, psychologically stimulating and exciting. A vertical laceration opens up the centre to infinity, an illusion provided by black fabric backing, the defining characteristic of both the work of Fontana and the genre of Spatialism. The intention is to cross the two dimensions a conventional artwork is limited to, elaboration of such will be detailed in the following analysis. A sense of eroticism is heavy in both the passionate coating of red and the nature of the slash, providing the art piece with a resemblance to female genitalia.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">33/365 (Bargaining)</h3>
    <p>1960's counterpart to the former example, instead furnished in an impure white, carries similar intent and essence (albeit featuring multiple lacerations). One can regard the slashes as cuts not only through a canvas, but through the fabric of reality itself. Within them is an infinite void, the challenging factor to the viewers' mind and emotion, as the illusion provided is in a manner beyond understanding, beyond meaning, and beyond the conscious; you don't see beyond the darkness within the outward canvas folds, you can only feel. The innocence of the near-white establishes a similutude to that of human skin; the art piece itself is metaphorically wounded human skin, cuts of boundless darkness permanently carved into it.
