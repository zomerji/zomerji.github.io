    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the fifteenth shoot, with inspiration derived from the varied works of Witchoria. Extensive creative liberty was taken, resulting in a shoot that was entirely unphysical.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> final is a composite image, containing alterations of source code exerpts in the C language extracted from Windows 10. Specifically, it is derived from the Boot Manager, a small software piece responsible for overseeing the starting of the operating system and is thus the first non-firmware software to be run. Through altering this code, I was able to create something of a computational story pertaining to mental health themes.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is similar to the first in theme, though is instead in a minimalist format, such being a custom error page on Google Chrome that was created through the editing of the browser code. Albeit unlike the first, this final is a state instead of story; one could interpret it as the emotional and mental state of nothingness, as is a typical symptom of depression. In that sense, less could mean more.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is an image-derived animation, featuring jitter and scanline filters alternating between pixellated and non-pixellated configurations, resembling a constant state of distortion.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is another animation. Through extensive client source code editing of the social media platform Discord, as well as editing of seperate clips to conjure the illusion of an entire interface interaction experience, I was able to create a short yet dynamic visceral story with a broad degree of room for interpretation. Each interface element was specially fabricated or modified to contribute to the final product.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is a second attempt on the second final's simplistic approach, though this time aesthetically emulating the interface of Windows XP in the Luna colour scheme. Said operating system was selected for the common nostalgia associated with it (and especially in my age group, it can evoke a sense of childhood), which I attempted to exploit by connotating it to the shoot's mental health theme. The image overall could represent a bittersweet nostalgia to childhood, intertwined with the present desire to 'restart', perhaps to return to that age once more.
