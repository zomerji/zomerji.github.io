    <p>This unnamed photograph, from an unknown album, depicts a city and motorway, at night. It is a long exposure, as well as a photographic manipulation, which I do find rather fascinating. I quite like how, compositionally, it appears to deliberately adhere to not actual technique or method whatsoever, yet it still follows minimalism, at least to a short extent. The colours are varying and captivating, as well as the tones themselves, and there appears to be no complete absence or overdoing of light anywhere. The reflection is convincingly cut out, and I like how it ‘feels’ to the eye as if it is in the correct place (in the centre), despite that, as previously stated, composition is likely not a primary factor in the construction and manipulation of this photograph.

    <p>This photograph appears in Siemer’s <i style="font-size: 14px;">Geometric Reflections</i> series, and depicts a rectangularly reflected mountain. I am quite fond of it, since overall, it appears rather simplistic and easy to visually comprehend, process, and interpret. The Rule of Threes is evidently used in this image, as the mountain (or, horizon) aligns to the lower column, therefore resulting in a large portion of negative space being utilised, likely, for the purpose of simplicity. I believe Siemer wished to adhere to such a theme, as it works best with reflective ‘flips’. It is almost as of the regularly-cut extract of the mountain is in the empty sky itself, floating freely, completely defying gravity for the purpose of photographic aesthetic appeal.
