    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The eleventh shoot has been a revisiting of a part of last years' work, which explored sport photography. This effort has been to not only apply my present skillset and ability to a past project, but also to expand on it beyond its original constraints. A few of the above finals have been 'remasters' of the original edits (though more in the sense of having been redone than retouched), but the others are entirely new takes on the original photographs.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> is a retry of a previous final, utilising the same original photograph. The former had featured a great degree of colour and contrast editing, resulting in a rather flat look that the vignetting did not mitigate. For this attempt, simplicity was key to providing the moment the justice it deserves. Colour was entirely eliminated in order to minimise points of distraction for the viewer, thereby granting each cyclist an equality akin to the competition they partook in. The finish line was cropped away, to emphasise the crucial mid-upper plane area (containing the important elements; the chequered flag, participants, spectators, and scenery), instead of draw away from it. The primary difficulty in this process was the mitigating of the bleaching highlights, which I felt undid the sunlight's dramatic effect.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is another reattempt, its previous counterpart I was unsatisfied with due to extensive cropping and background blurring (derived from compositional difficulties, particularly background activity), as well as overly elabourate contrast and clarity addition. For this attempt, I decided to follow the simplistic nature of the first final and, instead of attempt to hide away the chaotic background, fully embrace it in a journalistic fashion. The finished product is larger, more understandable, and more expressive alone from easing the compositional restriction. No scattered colours fight over and distract the viewer's eyes; all factors and elements are more cooperative, allowing the expression of the emotion and drama of the suspended moment far more effectively than the previous edit did.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> are two more reattempts, both applications of the skillset I have better expanded over the past year, with a focus on simplicity to aid viewing.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is a previously unfeatured image, depicting the culmination of the Elite (the highest) category race. Little editing (only contrast and monochrome colour balance factors were altered, as well as a few minor manipulations made) was required to achieve it, as its greatest attribute is composition, and there was no incentive to perform any effort other than to optimally express such.
