    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">These are the finals for the first shoot. Observations may conclude that some of the photographs are not entirely or much in the style of Andreas Gursky, and whilst such is subjectively correct, please note that I have not intended to replicate or even mimic his work. A shoot is where one applies inspiration and personal inference of the artists' work, and that is what I have attempted to my own ability. Whether I have succeeded in such, that goes just like as said in the <a href=../../work/a/introduction.html target=_blank>Introduction</a>; I can't say, only you can decide.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I started this shoot off with the broad objective of exercising what skills and methods I had developed over the past few years with photography, and more so, editing, as well as developing new ones. Gursky is not a compromising photographer nor editor, so I took the immense challenge in similar fashion. In the end, despite over 2000 images taken in a variety of environments, almost all were inadequate for the purpose.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Perhaps the primary subconscious factor behind Gursky's work is uncertainty over what is real and what isn't, following the conscious awe of what you see. And so for that matter, I will not tell you what of the photographs you have just seen is real, and what isn't. Methodry has been omitted from the <a href=experiments.html target=_blank>Experiments</a> page for the same reason.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I honestly wish I could expand on the effort, thinking processes, editing, and methods gone into this shoot. It is possibly the most difficult undertaking I have ever done in the subject. But unfortunately I would only be sabotaging myself, so for both my sake as well as yours, I will keep quiet.
