    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> final is of the individual who would finish second in the Elites race (and by a tenth of a second), posing whilst on the move. I chose this picture because it expresses an irony; a more informal and casual attitude against the individual’s (expected) strong emotion and suffering in the moment through fatigue and lactic acid effect. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is of a line of the racers well into the race. I decided to go for less of a mimicry of Ellis’ work here; I chose this to have an underlying meaning to it, which corresponds to the pace-setting section of the race that the photo was taken in. I won’t reveal the actual meaning, but instead I’ll leave it for you to figure out. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> is of the peloton just past the start and finish line, and I intentionally wished to depict the reaction of one of the participant’s families as the group went past. I don’t know which rider had the ‘audience’, but what matters is that I managed to capture authentic emotions. However, the image required motion blurring for cinematic effect, as the shutter speed was set at 1/800. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is of a passing-by cyclist who decided to take a few photos, and so I took that opportunity to capture my own which represents the contrast between the spectator/enthusiast and their kindled interest, and the pro/semi-pro and their profession. It took a few attempts to get the composition just right. The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is an image my cousin took of me on his bike that I edited. I am in the IAB position, which is something that the pros tend to do in world tour races, but since I am in low-end clothing and on low-end equipment, the photograph overall symbolises aspirations to succeed in a sport, through determination and persistence. Not much editing has been done here, besides colour and tone adjustment. Therefore, it is more ‘natural’. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> is my own bike stood in contrast against the racers on theirs, which is primarily a return to the ‘aspiration’ theme, and secondarily an anthropomorphism of the former aspect. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> is of a steward ringing ‘the bell’ at the start/finish line, which is used to inform the participants that it is the last lap. I am glad that the composition came out ideally (as my camera, limited to three frames per second and with a half-frame sensor, struggled to keep up throughout the race), although a higher aperture to have the man in focus would have been preferred. The <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a> is of another photographer taking pictures of the peloton, and with this I wanted to combine the theme of sport photography with the more almost-surrealist perspective of Andreas Gursky; a demonstration of sorts. I edited the tones and colours carefully, and removed anything that didn’t need to exist there. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a> is the finish of the race, the most important part of it, and unfortunately the closest shot to the actual line that I got (the next frame was the riders over the line). However, it was workable, and so I cropped it and adjusted the tones, colours, and other factors, to increase the dramatic and cinematic effect. The <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> is my favourite photo of this shoot, and depicts the runner-up and his teammate. This was by far the shot with the most authentic emotion in it, and the underlying meaning to it is too elabourate to express here. I edited the photograph with tonal and colour adjustment, background blurring, and other changes.
