  <p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Andreas Gursky is a German photographer based in Dusseldorf who is renowned for his large-format landscape photographs. Subgenres he has produced include architecture, portraiture, aerial, event, and fine art photography. He was a student of Bernd and Hilla Becher, a duo distinguished for their work on German industrial architecture, themes of which continue to show in Gursky's own work. What sets Gursky apart from the rest of the vast world of photography, however, is his almost fantastical style, wherein he manipulates the visual and subliminal nature of his images into hyperreality (a medium beyond reality but indistinguishable from fantasy, the only appropriate term I can think of). These are by all means as unrestrained as a picture can be, existing in prints as large as 4 x 2 m, with resolutions beyond anything imaginable today thanks to his usage of large-format cameras. Gursky's work from the late 20th century-onward has also been heavily reliant on computational technology to edit and enhance, an example being the use of algorithms to expand photographic spaces into perceived impossibility (a notable exemplar being Amazon).
