  <h1 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">How can surrealism be a tool for symbolic representation?</h1>

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This essay will be answering to a degree how surrealism can be utilised for the purpose of representational symbolism, and what effect it can have on the viewer. I will be exploring various themes and performing analysis, as well as evaluating from a Freudian perspective.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Andreas Gursky is the primary photographer I will be investigating. Gursky is a Düsseldorf-based photographer, renowned for his surrealist portraiture, who is mostly recognised for having produced the most expensive photograph in history (sold at $4.3 million). He was a student of Folkwang University of the Arts, Art Academy Düsseldorf, Universität Gesamthochschule Essen, and Studies with Bernd Becher, and held a professorship for Liberal Arts at the Art Academy in Düsseldorf. Currently, Gursky has a studio in Düsseldorf which he shares with fellow artists Thomas Ruff, Axel Hütte, and Laurenz Berges.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Whilst Gursky’s work seems to vary considerably, fundamentally it also does not. This may seem paradoxical, until you focus on what the fundamental themes and topical implications consist of. Particularly in the majority of his later and more major work is a strong surrealist essence of globalist-infused modernism deeply intermixed with contemporary neo-Romanticism, which is the thematic style that he is most renowned for and best distinguishes Gursky amongst counterpart Düsseldorf-school photographers and artists.

  <img style="padding-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src=https://publicdelivery.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Andreas-Gursky-Pyongyang-VII-2007-Arirang-Mass-Games.jpg>

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The most prominent example of Andreas Gursky’s inherent work theme, the absolute pinnacle of representation, I would argue lies in his notable Pyongyang series. Take for example Pyongyang VII, as shown above. A stunning and colourful showcase from afar actually consists of individual people dancing in flawless unison to depict a floral display orientated around a large and recoloured globe centred in orbit to North Korea itself. We view the spectacle at a low angle, where our perspective seems ideal to best witness it, as we have a high-depth-of-field array of subjects from the foreground to the background in almost perfect symmetry, except that signifies we are actually looking down on the people who may as well be performing for us. All the collective shapes and objects appear without error, but if one looks more closely, they’ll see that the constructive backboard’s colours are scuffed and uneven, and the microscopic individuality of each person is a relatively tiny imperfection but forms a much larger sense of flawing. It is too easy to be overwhelmed by the vastness of the display, the theatrical seemingly-perfection, and the strong colours, to be able to view the photograph as any less than the people it consists off. The people dance in strict order to construct a theatrical display, system that effectively dwarfs them. A system that seems to be ideal on first glance, but is flawed right to each individual that composes it.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">It lies not in the visual grandeur of this photograph, the true power, but in the subliminal meanings when one considers the visible cues and comprehends beyond what they believe they see. What you see is a grand display of Jucheist elegance and harmony. What I believe Gursky subconsciously intends to convey is a failing and tyrannical system upheld with and at the cost of the humans that laboriously uphold.

  <img style="padding-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src=https://www.andreasgursky.com/thumbs/works/1999/rhein-2/AndreasGursky-70f0f6df33d58eb19819248ed7edcc62-1000.jpg>

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">An exemplar that is visually different but symbolically and thematically similar is the most expensive photograph ever sold, as stated earlier; Rhein II. Depicting the river Rhine flowing through the Lower Rhine region in abstract form, minimalist in relativity to many of Gursky’s other works (where there is almost an overwhelming sense of clutter and minuity). And that is deliberate.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This photograph has a strong duality to it, a focus on a double subconscious meaning rather than a clear or at least solid conscious interpretation. You see the river and it’s tonal mirroring of the undisturbed sky, and the untampered greens of the grass by opposite riverbanks. You see the path traversing across in metrically flawless demeanour and in direct parallel to the river. Despite the abrupt transitioning between what is definitively natural and artificial, there is little to no disturbance in contrasting. Each has its qualities; the natural side has natural arbitrarity and thus more extensive interelemental presence of a natural chaos, and the artificial side has a manmade geometric idealness and therefore higher degree of artificial order. Yet there is something of the other in each; despite the random chaos of the natural, it is ordered as the artificial is. Despite the ordering of the artificial, the surface is randomly tainted in cosmetic chaos. And in the end, both coexist flawlessly. Both elements between the original world and our world are in harmony, dancing alongside each other in disciplinary fashion across the image. Gursky is painting a utopia wherein humans coexist alongside nature (instead of overrunning and overruling it as we do), and perhaps mocking our globalist greed.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">But change your perspective here and you may discover a different trail of interpretation altogether. Notice the tonal consistency; the absence of sunlight leads to the primary source of light being a relatively devoid sky, the reflection of which is present across the monochromatic ground-based counterparts; the river and the path. And despite the high saturated of the green of the grass, it’s overall a darker and impure colour that does not aesthetically resonate, a dull and unimpactful quality of one of the two most prominent elements. The compositional simplicity is in itself and in a way a factor against the photograph it represents, as visual substance is reduced to what effectively borders the point of lacking. Rhine II is deliberately uninteresting, due to its lack of presence of humanity, which otherwise would’ve granted the photograph more visual artificial substance and therefore a higher interest factor as Gursky’s other examples include. Gursky is suggesting that, despite our environmental degradation through our globalism and frantic consumerism, us humans artificially beautify the world.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">It is this Romanticism-infused duller form of photographic Abstractism in a hyperrealistic modernist medium that provides a vast degree of subliminality to this visually simplistic image, providing multiple simultaneous trains of thought. But in its own manner at that; Rhine II lacks the ‘sledgehammer’ awe-based aesthetic demeanour, and is instead far more subtle and therefore inferentially deeper.

  <img style="padding-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0223/4033/products/R902_708x.jpg>

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I have drawn a simple parallel to Rhein II and the work of Mark Rothko elsewhere, but only in the shallow context of reminiscent compositional substance; fairly simple, fairly ordered elements creating the smallest of mediums out of absolutely nothing. And I stand by that, but not really, at least not as initially intended.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Above we have No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red) from the American artist, his most expensive piece (sold for over $166 million). At its simplest, this Color Field painting depicting three distorted rectangles is worth 8340 acres of land. It is a reasonable exemplar of the artist’s later and best defining work.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">To interpret Rothko is to understand the visceral effect of the composition of his paintings and comprehend the subconscious psychology of the usage of specific colours. Both are closely intertwined, yet only one of the two is a particularly achievable process. The background colour of No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red) is the most prominent of all of Rothko’s and easily comprehendible as the colour that fascinated the American the most. It is the most visceral colour of all, as well as the second most visible, and studies have shown it to be capable of elevating blood pressure, increasing heart rate, and increasing respiration rate from mere visual exposure. Red is psychologically connotative of themes such as power, danger, passion, love, and aggression. A more primary colour over the red is a pale violet, a regal and soothing example, associable with mysticism, wealth, and exoticism. Purples are highly sensual, colours that are utilisable to simultaneously represent senses of smell, touch, and taste, as well as the conventional vision. The final primary example is a pale green, representative of optimism, nature, safety, envy, and luck. Green is a sickening yet psychologically a compassion-inducing colour, with strong sexual connotations.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">However, it would be shallow to try and infer a comprehensive meaning to No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red) through analysis of colour connotations and composition, or any sort of sensical meaning at all. Rothko was an abstract artist; his expression included not meaning nor conscious understandability, two quality devoidancies that define the abstract expressionist period. “If you are only moved by color relationships, you are missing the point. I am interested in expressing the big emotions - tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.”, he once quoted.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Understanding No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red) through your conscious is an impossible feat, because the true form of the painting does not lie there. Artwork, especially the abstract, is a compromise between conscious and subconscious understanding, what you understand and what you feel. In art, the former is fundamentally unnecessary (as proven in movements such as Cubism, Spatialism, Dadaism, Supremism, and so on), whilst the latter is required to form an experience between the painting and viewer. Art is not understanding, it is experiencing.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">By stripping away ideas, symbols, and discernible subjects into a pure form of colour and delineated forms of shape, Rothko creates a medium devoid of anything and everything rational, forming a purely-experience philosophy, intending to "eliminate all obstacles between the painter and the idea and between the idea and the observer". He would paint on large canvases that occupy the viewer’s field of view, and recommended that they stand merely eighteen inches during the viewing process to enable "a sense of intimacy, awe, a transcendence of the individual and a sense of the unknown."

  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">The result of such is a phenomenon as close as a painting can achieve to immersion, wherein the viewer is emotionally connected to the art piece to such a degree that they in a sense feel as if they are a part of it. The painting is no longer a painting, but a catalyst for transcendence on a subconscious level. And is the viewer’s role to attribute feelings and interpretations to it.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">In a variety of regards, Gursky cannot be compared to Rothko. Instead of underwhelming through maximum removal of rational elements, the former instead typically overwhelms through composed maximisation of elements down to the miniscule. Where Rothko liberally expresses chaos, Gursky orders it in a moderated intertwining with order. Where Gursky captures and manipulates, Rothko brushes.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The most significant difference, however, is both artists’ approach to subliminality. As previously explained, Rothko truly invests in and explores this area of consciousness, utilising the canvas as an array to catalyse the individual’s transcendence into a visceral realm of subconscious. A style that is both deliberately disciplined and laissez-faire chaotic.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">In comparison to Gursky, whom retains an unfaltering apathy. It’s easy to simply be in awe of the scaled intricacy of the German’s work and subsequently miss the subconscious cues altogether, because unlike Rothko’s artwork, you as the viewer are no part of the work except for the viewer, you are nothing more than you need to be. You are provided the ideal perspective but only to comprehend and interpret the photograph in your worldview, but otherwise are as fundamentally worthless as the subjects of the image itself; only a witness to the system you participate in raising to dwarf you into infinite unimportance. I would argue the deliberation of such, to enforce the cold truth of the reality of Gursky’s hyperreality (as it is only a hyperreality to optimally represent and symbolise the state of the first world). The work does not care whether you make it past the semi-surrealist aestheticism, because the world does not care whether you see past the reality of it to attribute your interpretation and emotionality to it. Where Rothko transcends you into thin air, Gursky throws you a pile of bricks for you to build your way up there.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Overall, through understanding the subliminal methodry both artists have implemented into their work, I have obtained a greater knowledge on what techniques can be effective for subconscious effect. It is through this research and investigation that I uncovered an error. A singular error, that I realised I was not the only one committing. As I looked around each fellow class members’ computer screen, it came to me realisation that they were all committing to it in addition. And as I looked about the classroom at the large photographic prints proudly pinned up on the walls, I discovered this error was present in the entire multiyear subject’s work.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This error takes shape in the fundamental philosophy behind everyone’s photo ‘production’. In short, it is that everyone photographs and edits singularly (discluding the interpretation of the photographer) for aesthetic appeal, without sufficient consideration of inherent subliminal meaning. It is an act akin to spending ten hours selecting the font of this essay, but only an hour typing it; there is little substance beyond the surface of what we individually want you to see in our individual images. There is nothing to be felt as the emphasis is entirely on cosmetics, a sort of ‘eyecandy’ factor everyone simultaneously strives to achieve without realisation that there is far more to artwork than one sees. Whilst it is a fair criticism of said point that, due to you having to evaluate a multitude of images, you are unlikely to spend a considerable time with each one, it in the end comes down to the point that each and every photograph in one’s portfolio has its place and purpose. A portfolio is not and should not be a Gursky picture, where it is filled with a near-infinite assortment of worthless constituencies. Each photo matters, and so the individual must strive to emphasize each’s effect and identity. I will be attempting to overcome this conscious boundary, and also attempting to assist others in doing so.
