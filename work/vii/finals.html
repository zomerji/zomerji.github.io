    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Before lay the finals for the seventh shoot, applications of my own interpretation of Andermann's work and her techniques, as well as my own skillset and creativity. This project easily became an exploration of the bounds of perception, through the adjusted presentation of various architectural forms to challenge the viewer.
    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a> and <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> challenge the sense of perception through the fusion of surrealism to architectural photography. Wires holding both scupltures from the ceiling were edited out, providing the illusion of being implausibly suspended in the air, with the surrounding abundance of surrounding glass frames contributing to the sense sense of ordered chaos. The inclusion of light had to be carefully controlled both during the shooting and editing phases, as too much would cause bleaching and compromise the ordered aspect of viewing, and too little would hamper tonal variation and the chaotic aspect. The <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a> is similar, though has its focus entirely on the perception factor instead of surrealism, through presenting the interior virtually perfectly albeit in a rotated and thus perplexing manner. The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is a different approach on exploring perception, this time utilising reflections to expand one viewpoint into another, in the case of ceiling light projected in an orderly fashion onto perpendicular glass. Said light was moderated during editing in order to allow the contents of the glass wall to be presented. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a> resembles the art of double exposures, though has barely been edited at all; two images are presented, the first as the foreground's gate, and the second as the landscape viewed through the gate's holed pattern, resulting in a peculiar amount of visual depth the viewer encounters and rapidly switches between. The <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a> is an area of ceiling, expressing a demeanour almost entirely orderly, save for minor disruptions in its pattern aligned in turn orderly; the wire junction is upon the upper left Rule of Thirds intersection, and the ceiling expands away partially to the Golden Ratio. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a>, and <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> combine emphasis on texture and composition through the control of their respective, intricate elements (the adjusting of texture, light, and tone), to interact in non-interfering mannerisms. The <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> is the infinite effect of two opposing mirrors, in turn further perplexified through the adjusting of the subject mirror to be perfectly situated within the image, despite the surrounding imperfect angles.
