    <p>This photograph was taken at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, and depicts a cyclist exiting the pit exit tunnel. I am rather fond of it, because it combines clever composition with an ideal balance of colours and tonal variation. The composition aspect is effective partially due to the use of the Rule of Thirds, which highlights the presence of the cyclist, who is the subject yet is the least visible feature of the image. The composition is also effective because the tunnel lights are used as directing points to the approximate location of the subject. The cyclist’s actual prominence in the photo is high, however, despite lower visibility, because he stands out from both the tunnel’s darkness and the outside track’s brightness. A medium aperture setting has clearly been used as the closest lights to the camera have a slight blurriness to them, although this is useful because it provides depth to the image, and assists in keeping the subject as the metaphorical centre of the photograph, even though they are the smallest primary feature.

    <p>This photograph was taken in an unknown location, and depicts a cyclist participating in a time trial practice. This is a photo that I definitely like, because again, there is very intelligent photographic design to it. Upon first glance, this does seem like a lower quality image because it appears blurry and distorted, as the viewer first sees the top of the picture. However, after a few seconds, you can see that it is of a puddle reflection, as the actual perspective is provided at the bottom of the photo and is upside-down. This already means that a high presence of texture is involved, as well as space; two evident formal elements. The fact that the actual perspective is contrasted with the reflection is, I feel, very important because there is at least a visible part of realistic clarity in the photograph, instead of all of it appearing to be distorted and therefore lower quality.
