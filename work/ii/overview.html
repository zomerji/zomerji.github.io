  <p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Andrea Caliò, self described as a "contemporary creative", is an Italian artist based in Bremen whom mostly creates ballpoint art, but also conducts photography and has numerous albums to his name. The contents of such albums are varied, ranging from candid to more fine-art, and minimalist to more 'cluttersome' architecture. However, the urban is a common and consistent factor among Caliò's photographs, something that varies considerably against his drawings, which are of portraiture.
