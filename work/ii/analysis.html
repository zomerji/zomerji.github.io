    <p>This photograph is as featured on the<i style="font-size: 14px;">Naked City - Fog</i> album published in January 2016, and depicts the foggy atmosphere of the suburbs belonging to an unknown city. This unnamed example is what I'd call a breakaway from the typical style, perhaps a stereotype of sorts, of how such a setting would be ideally photographically depicted; a maximisation of used space to best express the assortment of subject matter. Here, the natural setting of darkness and fogginess directly opposes such. There is an evident maximisation of negative space where the street lights fail to illuminate; blinding lights that can only light to a limited scope, yet where they shine is what you see. Monochromacy emphasises the tones and textures of everything between the gritty roads, polygonally-textured pavements, and the noise suspended mostly clearly in the most well-lit areas that provide a very noire feel and manner to the picture, evoking a deep chill feeling within me I can't quite describe. Compositionally, there are further advancements. What may as well be the primary subject, the bus stop filtering the luminance of the street light behind through condensed glass, is by the right Rule of Thirds column. To where your vision fades away to the left is around where the left column lies. The centermost zone, where the illumination is at its most throttling intensity, loosely adorns a Golden Rectangle. As an overview, this unnamed photograph is resemblant of some thriller or horror fifties movie, with its very uncontemporary aesthetic demeanour and dark subliminality.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><i style="font-size: 15px;">Unnamed </i>(2015)</h3>
    <p>This image is presumably indoor of house in Japan, and is as featured on the <i style="font-size: 14px;">Japan Mon Amour</i> published in January 2016. Admittedly, this is a photograph I had initially overlooked due to what I percieved as a lack of anything particularly good and particularly bad. However, upon viewing it more, I've began to appreciate it. The primary factor that this picture excels in is composition, through the way it combines elements visually inwards to produce a highly natural-looking and 'human' wormhole-like visual effect from far inside the house to some distance outside it. Each wall or ceiling element oppositely overlaps at fourty-five-degree angles, drawing the eyes deeper into the image. The only colours that are particularly prominent are the vegetative greens outside and centermost, which is likely an aiding factor for that area being the center of attention when compared to the more passive and duller creams and browns of inside. Likewise follows for brightness, with said zone brightened significantly more than everywhere else, though this forms the problem of more upper and lower areas lacking enough light to even be consistent with close counterparts. Something further to note, which I find quite fascinating, is the fact that, despite their being a very firm area of focus, there is no singular primary subject.
