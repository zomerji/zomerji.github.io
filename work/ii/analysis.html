    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;"> Rhine II (1999) </h3>
    <p> This photo depicts the river Rhine. It's difficult to understand how I feel about it, for there truly is not much to see and feel. Reminiscent of some photographic Rothko piece, where all you're left with is the resulting feeling from the most basic formal elements. Perhaps said subconscious neutrality is intentional. Being a manipulated work, it's not easy to know what exactly has been changed, as is the case with Gursky and the hyperrealistic visual atmospheres he produces, although a <a href=https://live.staticflickr.com/4476/36868849923_497414df80_b.jpg target=_blank>photo</a> from a similar location helps put things into perspective. The industrial background of the river has been removed entirely, the sky decontrasted and smoothened, and the individual elements themselves (i.e. the path, river sides, and grass fields) visually-perfectly straightened and aligned. Other presumed edits are the contrast, clarity, colour balance, vibrance, and saturation, although I would consider these less relevant. Of course, this isn't without purpose; I believe there are multiple reasons for choosing to manipulate the picture in said way. Firstly, it's to portray how the Lower Rhine would appear in mutual coexistence with humankind; in Gursky's reality here, both factions are in unison and advance across the print in flawless parallel, signifying the idealism of a world where humans can exist alongside nature peacefully. The depth in this lies in the fact that, in reality, humans have tainted the area with industrialism (and therefore progressive selfishness) without second thought for nature. However, it's a double-sided coin. For secondly, it's to represent how the Lower Rhine would appear without human addition (in this case, in the form of industrialism). The landscape here is flat, duller, featureless and lacking in identity. Humans take these flaws away, and subsequently it is humans who make the world more beautiful. I believe, overall, that this portrays the duality of mankind and it's relationship with nature.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;"> Pyongyang VI (2017/2007) </h3>
    <p>This image is of the Arirang Festival in North Korea. At first sight of it, it's difficult not to be completely taken in by the aesthetic grandeur that is the human-based display that has been photographed. Again, it's hyperreality, only this differs from the first in the sense that it doesn't appear to shy from it's nature, only that the catch here is that it's a visual trick; it's <a href="

Elements I believe have been changed are; the formation of the people, the removal of anything except the relevant subjects (i.e. the stadium background and the faces in the 'mosaic'), and universal photographic factors such as the colour balance, contrast, brightness, etc. I won't elaborate further because I wish to focus on the subliminality of the picture. You have the dancers arranged in virtually flawless patterns, and near the middle is where the formation is brightest, the 'epicentre'. Situated directly below the sun, I believe it represents Juche, the nuclear ideology of North Korea. Around it are the bright members, who are the people of the country, and combined with the epicentre, that's what forms North Korean society, portrayed by themselves as idealistic, warm, prosperous. But then, away from the centre, you have the purple dancers. They're a colder colour, lie down, and don't circle the bright epicentre. they're the human lives this problematic 'utopia' has cost. and there's an incredible amount of them, and they're arranged in lines that flow away from the coloured centre, possibly signifying that there are more lives constantly streaming out of the totalitarian and ruthless regime. Overall, I believe this photo is a brutally-blunt portrayal of the manufactured delusional idealism that is North Korean ideology;  beautiful and colourful utopia at first glance, but created, and at the cost of humans who dance around and along to it in unison like controlled and insignificant creatures.
