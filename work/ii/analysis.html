    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Trinity College Library Dublin I, 2004</h3>
    <p>This photograph is part of the album <i style="font-size: 14px;">Candida Höfer: Libraries</i>. It depicts the Long Room in the library of the Trinity College, Dublin. It is an exemplar of her work and epitomises her style and method. Geometrically as well as visually, the technical perfection of this image is unrivalled in all examples of architecture photography that I’ve seen. It is taken in the centerline point of both the width (hence, the metric symmetry) and the height, to emphasize two aspects of depth (through height as well as conventional depth, as in, away from the lens). The viewpoint is suspended halfway in the air so that the depth of the building up, down, and away, are best expressed. The colours are more passive and cooperate with the medium state of tonal variation to provide a visual experience that is awe-inspiring and breathtaking, but also tranquilisingly appealing and even possibly relaxing to some extent. It still retains the upfront impression that Höfer is renowned for, but not the aggression that you see in her theatre images.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Biblioteca Vasconcelos, 2015</h3>
    <p>This photograph depicts the interior of the Vasconcelos Library in Mexico City. The amount of depth in this image is astounding, and the visual depiction itself resembles more of an architectural, artificial skeleton. It is my favourite picture because it plays with the viewer’s comprehension of space and depth, and incorporates the library in a medium where it’s design and engineering is composed and visually pleasing. However, with <i style="font-size: 14px;">Biblioteca Vasconcelos</i>, the expression of the building is entirely different to whatever work Höfer has done before. All other work uses shape, form, and depth, but plays with the themes of order and disorder, and effectively contrasts the two in something of an irony. The disorder is the more franticity of the design, with the dramatic and unwithholded shapes and depths, and the sharp and cinematic tones. The order, on the other hand, is the technical perfection; the shapes and objects are all ordered, even if they try to express otherwise. This photographic duality is why this photograph is a masterpiece.
