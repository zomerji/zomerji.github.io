    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This shoot took place at five locations. However, there were numerous setbacks. Firstly, that most locations were either too dark to take adequate non-tripod photographs with, or too crowded to capture the entirety of the architecture itself. Thirdly, all the images taken in St. Pancras (albeit, my best ones) were rather conveniently all corrupted (along with some others) and so could not be accessed afterwards. Fourthly, I was not able to borrow a tripod from school, and so all images were taken with optical metrics. Other than that, the shoot proceeded relatively smoothly.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I was unsatisfied with the results when I reviewed and attempted editing them, as the metrics I had to resort to using my own eyes and a steady hand for were flawed; the images looked technically imperfect and so were not anything reminiscent of Höfer’s work. Fortunately, I was able to develop a Photoshop method that essentially created an element of complete symmetry. The photographs that incorporated this technique are the <a class=hyperlink href="#i">first</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#iii">third</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#iv">fourth</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#v">fifth</a>, <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a>, and <a class=hyperlink href="#ix">ninth</a>.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">The <a class=hyperlink href="#ii">second</a> is of the church of the Imperial College in London, and fortunately I was able to take it with enough optical symmetry that it didn’t need to be mirrored afterwards. The only issue was that it was taken in low-lighting conditions, and I was unlenient on the exposure because I wished to preserve the quality. It was selectively brightened and cropped. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vi">sixth</a> is of a lounge in the Freemasons House, and although appears unedited, has in fact been. The issue with it was that the topmost part of the picture was too bright, and I unfortunately was not able to fully resolve this. The <a class=hyperlink href="#vii">seventh</a> is of a library room in the Freemasons House, which has been mirrored and enhanced. However, I am listing it here because I used another method with it, and that being including a dual-tone gradient to improve colour and tonal variation, and to increase the appeal of the image altogether. A high-temperature tint from the top of the photograph was selectively gradiented into a high-vibrance version of the lower part, which causes a heightwise contrast. Altogether, there is virtually-total symmetry and therefore almost zero contrast on the latitudinal axis, and a high-profile contrast on the longitudinal axis. The <a class=hyperlink href="#viii">eighth</a> is the example of the finals that is least alike to Höfer’s style, as it lacks any symmetry at all, has a very extensive amount of tones, and zero colour. However, the reason for there being no colour was because the Somerset House Dungeons had zero colour at all, so I decided to work with it and exploit the tonal potential. In hindsight, I think the shoot would’ve been fine without it, but I’ve retained it due to it’s experimental nature. The <a class=hyperlink href="#x">tenth</a> is an example of Somerset House which could’ve been mirrored, but I opted for this one to differ from every other exterior image of the building and retain it’s canditity.
